# Light Intensity Sensor

This a simple IoT application that tracks light intensities and plots these values in awesome real-time graphs. For use it you need:
- An arduino microcontroller
- One light intensity resistor
- One resistance (1k)
- One bread board

## How to install
You can get the code cloning this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Fortiz2305/arduino.git`

## How to use
You have to connect the light intensity resistor to the bread board properly and connect both to the laptop.

Later, you have to create a "plot.ly" account and save your username, api key and token. Finally, you only need execute:

`node server.js`.

You can check your statistics on plot.ly in real-time.
